# AcidityModder
## About
AcidityModder is an application written in C# made to help you make Minecraft modifications. It works in a similar fashion to MCP (ModCoderPack).

## How It Works
### Decompilation
AcidityModder decompiles the Minecraft Client. This is where the actual code can be accessed.

### Mapping
After decompiling, it applies custom mappings to make the source code readable.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you would like to contribute. I need other people to help with this, so it would be appreciated.

## Note
This project is being worked on a bunch, and is a work in progress. Expect bugs!
